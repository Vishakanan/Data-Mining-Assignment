# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression and Linear Regression  

## Overview  
This project applies **Logistic Regression** and **Linear Regression** models on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** to analyze and compare their effectiveness in detecting breast cancer.  

- **Logistic Regression** is used as a classification model to predict whether a tumor is **benign (0)** or **malignant (1)**.  
- **Linear Regression** is applied on the probability scores generated by Logistic Regression to estimate continuous malignancy probabilities.  

The goal is to evaluate the performance of both models in supporting **early detection** and **clinical decision-making**.

## Dataset  
The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**.  

- Features: 9 independent variables (e.g., Clump Thickness, Cell Size, Cell Shape, Bare Nuclei, etc.)  
- Target:  
  - `2 → Benign` → mapped to `0`  
  - `4 → Malignant` → mapped to `1`  

### Data Preprocessing Steps  
- Missing values in `Bare Nuclei` were imputed using **mean imputation**.  
- Train-test split: **80% train, 20% test**.  
- Features normalized to float.

## Model Implementation  

### 1. Logistic Regression  
- Trained with `class_weight='balanced'`.  
- Achieved:  
  - **Train Accuracy:** ~96.9%  
  - **Test Accuracy:** ~97.1%  
- Evaluation metrics:  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - Confusion Matrix  

### 2. Linear Regression  
- Used **logistic regression probabilities** as target values.  
- Evaluated with:  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 0.0152  
  - **R² Score:** 0.925  
- Feature importance analyzed through regression coefficients.

##  Results  

### Logistic Regression (Classification)  
- High accuracy on both training and test data.  
- Balanced precision and recall for both benign and malignant classes.  
- Confusion Matrix showed very few misclassifications.  

### Linear Regression (Probability Estimation)  
- Strong correlation between predicted and actual malignancy probabilities.  
- Useful for **risk scoring** rather than direct classification.
